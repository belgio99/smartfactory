USER QUERY: "{_USER_QUERY_}"

INSTRUCTION: 
Using the provided "CONTEXT DATA," generate a structured and insightful report based on the user's query. The report must align with the detailed format below and fully utilize the contextual information provided in the input JSON. You must replace placeholders ([PLACEHOLDER]) with actual data or "None" if unavailable. 

Ensure that:
- Computed KPIs and Forecasted KPIs are clearly distinguished and organized per machine.
- Statistical summaries (mean, max, min) for computed KPIs are accurately extracted from json inputs. If a statistic is not available in the input, explicitly state "None."
- Forecasted KPI predictions are displayed with the associated prediction dates.
- An Overall Summary provides comparative insights across machines, with sections on:
  - Machine comparisons for computed KPIs.
  - Key takeaways from predicted values.
- Ensure the response remains concise, avoids unnecessary commentary, and directly addresses the USER QUERY using the contextual data.
- do not panic if some fields in the input not coincide precisely 

Context format:
- Computed KPI:
  - Machine_name: The name of the machine analyzed.
  - KPI_name: The unique identifier of the computed KPI.
  - Value: Computed KPI value or an error message if parameters are invalid.
  - Measure_unit: The KPI's unit of measurement (e.g., percentage, seconds, units).
  - Date_start: Start date for the KPI computation (DD/MM/YYYY). If Date_finish is NULL, this refers to a single day.
  - Date_finish: End date for aggregated KPI values, or NULL if not aggregated.
  - Aggregator: The aggregation function used (min, max, avg...), or NULL if no aggregation applies.
  - Forecast: Always false for computed KPIs.
- Forecasted KPI:  
   - Machine_Name: Name of the machine for which the KPI prediction is reported.  
   - KPI_Name: Unique identifier for the forecasted KPI.  
   - Predicted_value: Forecasted KPI value or a list of value if forecasting refers to more then one day
   - Lower_bound: Minimum predicted value within the confidence interval for the KPI.
   - Upper_bound: Maximum predicted value within the confidence interval for the KPI.
   - Confidence_score: Numerical value (0-1) indicating the confidence level of the prediction (e.g., 0.95 for 95% confidence).
   - Measure_unit: Unit of measurement for the KPI (e.g., percentage, seconds, units).  
   - Date_prediction: Date of the KPI prediction (DD/MM/YYYY) or a list of date if forecasting refers to more then one day.  
   - Forecast: Always true for forecasted KPIs.  
   - Error_message: an error message in case something goes wrong

-- SUMMARY --

Machine Comparisons: 

[Comparison insights across machines for computed KPIs.]


Predicted Values Insights: 

[Key insights and expected trends.]


Suggestions:

[Key suggestions based on KPI values and expected trends.]

REQUIREMENTS:
- Ensure the report is clear and error-free, with no redundant text such as "Here’s your report."
- Use the input JSON to compute summaries accurately; if data is missing, explicitly state its absence.
- Respond strictly in the requested report format.
- For a machine reports only the forecasted KPIs, if there are no forecasted values, please don't put in the report the "Forecasted KPIs" section for the machines with no forecasted values
- If Error_message is not empty in forecasted KPI report the error
- If Value in computed KPI contains an Error message report the error
