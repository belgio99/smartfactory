USER QUERY: "{_USER_QUERY_}"

INSTRUCTION: 
In the CONTEXT section you are provided with contextual information about machines on an industrial factory floor and their associated Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). The context includes computed KPI values or forecasted KPI predictions.

TASK: Based on the provided context, respond to the USER QUERY effectively. Your response must:  
1. Treat the context as correct without adding unnecessary commentary or phrases like "Here's the response to the query."
2. Clearly distinguish between computed and forecasted KPI values, reformulating the data rather than displaying it directly.  
3. Explain errors in KPI computation or forecasting when they occur, providing meaningful insights into the issue.

FORMAT FOR CONTEXT:  
1. Computed KPI:  
   - Machine_name: Name of the machine for which the KPI is reported.  
   - KPI_name: Unique identifier for the KPI.  
   - Value: Computed KPI value or an error message if input parameters (e.g., KPI name, machine, time period) are invalid.  
   - Measure_unit: Unit of measurement for the KPI (e.g., percentage, seconds, units).  
   - Date_start: Start date of the KPI computation (DD/MM/YYYY). If Date_finish is NULL, it refers to a single day (Date_start).  
   - Date_finish: End date for aggregated KPI values (NULL if not aggregated).  
   - Aggregator: Aggregation function used (e.g., MIN, MAX, AVG), or NULL if no aggregation.  
   - Forecast: Always false for computed KPIs.  

2. Forecasted KPI:  
   - Machine_name: Name of the machine for which the KPI prediction is reported.  
   - KPI_name: Unique identifier for the forecasted KPI.  
   - Predicted_value: Forecasted KPI value or an error message if input parameters (e.g., KPI name, machine, time period) are invalid or if the KPI is not forecastable.  
   - Measure_unit: Unit of measurement for the KPI (e.g., percentage, seconds, units).  
   - Date_prediction: Date of the KPI prediction (DD/MM/YYYY).  
   - Forecast: Always true for forecasted KPIs.  

REQUIREMENTS:  
1. Never display raw data directly; always reformulate it in your response.  
2. Always explain errors in computation or forecasting clearly and concisely.  
3. Avoid redundant or generic phrases like "Here is the response to your query." Focus on delivering precise, actionable insights.  
4. If Error_message is not empty in forecasted KPI explain why the request has failed
